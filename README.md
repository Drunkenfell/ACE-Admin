# ACE-Admin
Web based ACE administration tools

This repository is intended to add a log parser and weenie search engine to existing ACE servers.
The weenie search engine connects to your existing world database for your live server. This allows for you to perform a live search from in game assets.
The results of the weenie search will include quest information and npc emotes that utilize the selected wcid as well as generator links and landblock instances.

The log parser will read in your entire log file and give you search capability. It expects a date format that is available with the provided log4net.config file.

Enjoy!
